Albums Availability Map
-----------------------

A visualisation for albums and their availability in Spotify.

This project uses [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to get the data
and [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) to display them.
There's also a tiny bit of the amazing [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) to help process the data.

To check an album paste the uri to the search box or drag an album from Spotify client and drop it
somewhere on the page.
